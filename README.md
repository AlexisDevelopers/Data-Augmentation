Here we use the data augmentation technique to improve the generalizability of a neural network model.

Data augmentation is a technique used to generate new images from existing training images by applying transformations like rotation, translation, brightness change, etc. By generating new training images, you can train more robust models that better generalize the new data.

The code starts by importing the necessary libraries, including TensorFlow, NumPy, and Matplotlib. Next, import the Fashion MNIST dataset, which is used as an example in this code.

The data is then split into training and test sets using Sklearn's data splitter. Then, a basic convolutional neural network model is defined to classify the images. The model is compiled using the root mean square error loss function and the stochastic gradient descent optimizer with a learning rate of 0.5.

Once the model is built, it is trained on the training dataset and the test dataset is used for validation. The EarlyStopping object is used as a callback to stop training if the model stops improving after a specified number of epochs.

Different imagers with different data augmentation techniques are then used to create new test images from the existing test images. These generators are used to test the pretrained model to see how it behaves on the disturbed test images. Finally, a perturbed training imager is created and the model is trained on this augmented training data set.

Finally, this code shows how to use the data augmentation technique to improve the accuracy and generalizability of a neural network model. Data augmentation is an important technique in deep learning that is widely used to improve model performance in a wide variety of applications.
